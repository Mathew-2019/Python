# Kick-off

Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming.

We would be using Jupyter Notebook, sometimes also refered as IPython.
IPython is the Python backend to the Jupyter Notebook, which is also known as the kernel, which is an interactive Python shell.

# Installation

Mac OS X and Linux comes pre installed with python. 
Windows users can download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ .

# To install IPython run,
```
$ pip install ipython[all]
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies for the notebook, qtconsole, tests etc.

# Installation from unofficial distributions

Installing all the necessary libraries might prove troublesome. Anaconda and Canopy comes pre packaged with all the necessary python libraries and also IPython.

# Anaconda

Download Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

Anaconda is completely free and includes more than 300 python packages. Both python 2.7 and 3.4 options are available.
We would be utilizing the Jupiter Notebook for our learning purpose. 

# To Launch Jupiter From the terminal

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.

```
jupyter notebook
```
